# Work Breakdown Structure
Date:  2022-03-01 17:24

The WBS is a view into the project that illustrates the work the project encompasses. The Project Manager and project team use the WBS to develop the project schedule, resource requirements, and costs. There are many ways you can present the WBS for your project; this template provides some of the popular layouts from which you can choose. Different layouts may be more suitable for different purposes (presentations vs. plan documentation, for example). 
In order to save space in this template we only developed the WBS examples down to the third level. In your project you may want to develop them further.
Note: Instructions for what to include in each section appear in gold italics.

##  Outline View
The outline view presents an easy to view and understand layout for the WBS. It is also a good layout to use when developing the WBS because you can easily make changes, especially since the Microsoft Word auto numbering feature updates the WBS Code automatically.

## Hierarchical Structure
The hierarchal structure is similar to the outline view but without indentation. Although this format is more difficult to read, it may be useful where you have many levels and indenting each level would make the table too large to fit into a document.

## Tabular View
The Tabular View is a nicely organized table view of the WBS. It is a good option for organizations which prefer table formats.

## Tree Structure View
The Tree Structure View is the most popular format for the WBS. It presents an easy to understand view into the WBS; however, it is also tricky to create without an application specifically designed for creating this organizational chart structure. The Tree Structure below was created using only Microsoft Word and the SmartArt graphics option under the insert menu. Microsoft Visio is also useful for creating this view.

## WBS Dictionary
The WBS Dictionary contains all the details of the WBS which are necessary to successfully complete the project. Most importantly it contains a definition of each Work Package which can be thought of as a mini scope statement. Resources on the project will look at the WBS dictionary to determine the scope of the Work Package they've been assigned, so it's important to be clear when writing the definition.

| Level | WBS Code | Element Name                            | Definition                                                                                                                                                                    |
